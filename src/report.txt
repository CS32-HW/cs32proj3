1. INTERACTION BETWEEN PLAYER AVATAR AND A GOODIE

When the player avatar attempts to move to a space, it asks the StudentWorld if
there are any movable objects and attempts to move that object. If there are no
movable objects, the player avatar asks the StudentWorld if there are any
obstructive objects (objects that return false when canShareSpace() is called)
in which case the player avatar doesn't move. If there are no obstructive
objects, the player avatar moves onto that space. The co-location is detected by
the goodie, which checks if the player avatar shares the same coordinates by
asking the StudentWorld for the location of the player. If the goodie detects
co-location with the player, it sets its HP to 0, plays the sound
SOUND_GOT_GOODIE, and runs the protected pure virtual function effect(), which
is overridden by all the Item subclasses. The effect() function can increase the
score, restore player health, etc. depending on the specific goodie.

For example, an iteraction between the player avatar and an extra life goodie:

Avatar.doSomething()  : player moves onto the same spot as a goodie
ExtraLife.doSomething : uses doSomething() method defined in parent class
                        'Goodie'
Goodie.doSomething()  : uses doSomething() method defined in the parent class
                        'Item'
Item.doSomething()    : if co-located, kill itself, play SOUND_GOT_GOODIE, runs
                        pure virtual function effect()
ExtraLife.effect()    : increase score by 1000 and increment # of player lives

2. UNFINISHED FUNCTIONALITY AND KNOWN BUGS

I believe I have implemented all functionality and there are no bugs to the best
of my knowledge.
